<details><summary>Softalkのセットアップ手順</summary>

## 対象デバイス

- Windows

## 手順

このソフトウェアにはSoftalkが含まれていないので、まずはインストールします。     
[Softalk](https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/winnt/art/se412443.html)をダウンロードして、解凍、中から出てきた `softalk` フォルダを `damare/softalk` に配置します。

`damare/softalk/SofTalk.exe` を実行し、環境設定を開きます。

### OpenJTalkを使用する場合

以下の手順に従って、OpenJTalkをセットアップします。

<details><summary>OpenJTalkのセットアップ手順</summary>

## 対象デバイス

- Linux
- Windows
- Mac

## 手順

### Linuxの場合

Ubuntuでは、以下のようにしてOpenJTalkをインストールします。

```sh
sudo apt install open-jtalk
```

Ubuntu以外でも同様にOpenJTalkをインストールします。     

### Windowsの場合

[Windowsで音声合成Open JTalk \- Qiita](https://qiita.com/mkgask/items/0bf9c26dc96e7b0b45ac)

こちらの記事を参考に、OpenJTalkをインストールします。

その後、OpenJTalkのフォルダにパスを通します。

### Macの場合

Homebrewインストール環境下で

```sh
brew install open-jtalk
```

と実行して、OpenJTalkをインストールします。

</details>

[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)にアクセスして、アプリケーションのトークンを取得します。

`damare/config.yml`を作成し、以下のように編集します。      
guildIdでは、使用するサーバーのIDを入力してください。       
prefixには、コマンドとして認識するための識別子を入力します。（例えばprefixに`;`を設定すると、コマンドは`;help`のようになります。）

```yml
token: token
useguild: guildId
prefix: ";"
```

以下のコマンドで実行します

```bash
yarn start
```

## Q&A

### Botが読み上げなくなった

内部エラーによりキューの処理が正常にされなかった可能性があります。      
`reset`コマンドを実行してみてください。それでも直らない場合は`stop`で一度停止してから`talk`で再度読み上げ開始してみてください。

それでも直らない場合はお手数ですがBotを再起動してください。

### Botを実行すると実行したPCがうるさい

使い方にある`録音時は読み上げを省略する`にチェックを入れたかどうか確認してください。
